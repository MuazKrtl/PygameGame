# A Game With Python Pygame

First of all, sorry for untidy project files. I made it so many years ago so i am not able to clean it up. The ".tmx" files are coming from tilemap creator which is an application for making maps to pygame games. And ".tsx" files are part of it too. Other ".png" things are the animations or tile images. You dont need to worry about them.

# Game Mechanics
**Game has these mechanics:**

 - Camera following/moving
 - Character moving and collision
 - Map collision and Map rendering
 - Different Levels
 - Lightning 
 - Animations and Cutscenes
 - Sound Effects

# How to run it?
The "real" files are ".py" files. And the "main" file is realgame.py. I couldnt make an executable file. So download all files and open realgame.py with vscode or any other ide and run it.

# How to play?
Arrow keys to move and f to take torch in game.
1-2 to change item at hand and g-h keys to change gravity in second level
